Thank you for downloading MenuCustomizer!

This editor extension allows you to customize the context menu.

+- How To Use

You can customize the context menu by the preference window.
That window is opened by the following menu path.

  UnityMenu > Window > Menu Customizer

If you want to show the sample,
please push the [Use unity's default] button.

This tool supports the menu path that can be called from "EditorApplication.ExecuteMenuItem()" method.
So, you can't use some of the menu path.
For example, "File/New Scene", "Edit/Look View to Selected", "Help/About Unity", etc.
